# There are three categories of ROS Parameters that can be used to configure the amcl node: overall filter, laser model, and odometery model.

kld_z: 0.99                         # Upper standard normal quantile for (1 - p), where p is the probability that the error on the estimated distrubition will be less than kld_err.

                                    ## This saved pose will be used on subsequent runs to initialize the filter. -1.0 to disable.
use_map_topic: true                 # When set to true, AMCL will subscribe to the map topic rather than making a service call to receive its map. New in navigation 1.4.2
first_map_only: true                # When set to true, AMCL will only use the first map it subscribes to, rather than updating each time a new one is received. New in navigation 1.4.2
selective_resampling: false         # When set to true, will reduce the resampling rate when not needed and help avoid particle deprivation. 
                                    ## The resampling will only happen if the effective number of particles (N_eff = 1/(sum(k_i^2))) is lower than half the current number of particles.

# Odometry model parameters
## If ~odom_model_type is "diff" then we use the sample_motion_model_odometry algorithm from Probabilistic Robotics, p136; 
## this model uses the noise parameters odom_alpha1 through odom_alpha4, as defined in the book.
## If ~odom_model_type is "omni" then we use a custom model for an omni-directional base, 
## which uses odom_alpha1 through odom_alpha5. The meaning of the first four parameters is similar to that for the "diff" model. 
## The fifth parameter capture the tendency of the robot to translate (without rotating) perpendicular to the observed direction of travel.
