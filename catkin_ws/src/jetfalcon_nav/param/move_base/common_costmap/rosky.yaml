                                                                 ## both clockwise and counter-clockwise orderings of points are supported.
footprint_padding: -0.01                                         # Amount to pad footprint (m).

#robot_radius: 0.18                                              # The radius of the robot in meters, this parameter should only be set for circular robots,

#robot_base_frame: base_footprint      # The name of the frame for the base link of the robot.

# Rate parameters
update_frequency: 0.5                  # The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated. Default is 5.0
publish_frequency: 0.5                 # The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information. Default is 0.0.
transform_tolerance: 1.0               # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. 
                                       ## This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. 
                                       ## For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. 
                                       ## If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the "global_frame" and "robot_base_frame" parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), 
                                       ## then the navigation stack will stop the robot.
                                       ## Default is 0.2.
